# Rainbow tracker converters

This repository is meant for storing migrators which convert old data to new data
structure. The project started with the backend being Firebase Realtime Database 
and went through some changes in the data structure that required conversions. 
Then, a REST API was developed so data had to be converted again. Each converter 
has a README explaining a little more about that specific migration.
